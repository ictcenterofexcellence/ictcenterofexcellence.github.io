This paper presents a solution to getting the training images by virtually generating synthetic training images in the game engine Unity3D. This has the potential to greatly speed up training and iteration time, as gathering of input images becomes much simpler.</p>',14)]))}const c=t(r,[["render",o]]);export{u as __pageData,c as default};
